<h1>Introduction to Information Technology - Assignment 1 - Daniel Kljucevic</h1>

<h2>Personal information</h2>
<p>My name is Daniel Kljucevic and I am studying Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT</p>
<p>Student number: s3851555</p>
<p>Student email: s3851555@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
<p>I am currently employed in the public service as a Business Analyst.  I work with business to standardise client correspondence.  We have a small number of policies relating to the use of language and structure to be used in our written information.  My role is to advise business on how to implement these standards within their written correspondence.</p>  
<p>Previously, I was the technical lead for an IT system called Genesys.  This role was divided into incident and change management.  Incident management involved a lot of technical discussions as part of the incident (and problem management) process.  Change management involved analysing business requirements and working with the technical teams to implement these.</p>
<p>Personally, I am a long-time subscriber to Everquest II.  I also enjoy photography/astrophotography.  I have watched the Harry Potter series <i>many times...</i></p>


<h2>Personal interests in IT</h2>

<p>My primary interests probably actually revolve around gaming and hardware.  However, I aim to get into programming or otherwise databases, web development.</p>  
<p>I have held positions in multiple IT organisations over the years.  Since I was a kid, I have always been interested in computers, and the more I am exposed the more interested I become.  My interest in IT as a career probably started when I worked for IBM Global Services as an I/O Operator doing data backups.  This role would often have me going down to the server room.  I really enjoyed watching and learning about the tape libraries, some of which used robots.  I have been in data centres since then and continue to be fascinated.</p>  
<p>I came to RMIT through OUA.  RMIT seems to be fairly well ranked when compared to other universities.  It was important to me that if I actually start a degree that I get a good education.  I would prefer to be on campus but this is not possible given my other responsibilities - family, full-time job.</p>

<h2>Ideal job</h2>

<h3><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/41153294?type=standard#searchRequestToken=70c92434-28a1-478d-912f-f850fa391c2c">Senior Java Developer | Docker, AWS, Microservices</a></h3>

<p>This is a senior Java developer role that requires knowledge/experience in a number of related tools. It appears the applications being developed may be cloud based.</p>
<p>Skills and experience in Java (v8-11) and Angular as well as and a number of tools and processes designed to manage and deploy software packages including Docker, OpenShift, Ci/CD pipelines.
I believe that some of the skills and experience required for this role will come with work experience.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/41127321?type=standout#searchRequestToken=70c92434-28a1-478d-912f-f850fa391c2c">Senior/Lead Java Developer - Investment Banking - Risk Services</a></h3>

<p>This role would have me working with a team to rebuild the organisation's risk calculation and management platform.  The project will rebuild the solution using Java/Python/Scala from C++.</p>
<p>Skills and experience in the design, build and delivery of Java applications as well as SQL, scripting in Unix and Python, AWS, CI/CD pipelines, relevant educational and (financial) industry experience.
Again, some of the skills around application management and deployment will come from work experience. SQL can probably be learned, to some degree, without work experience.  As too can Python.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/41152980?type=standard#searchRequestToken=70c92434-28a1-478d-912f-f850fa391c2c">Fullstack Java Developer (12month contract- $950pd)</a></h3>

<p>This role appears to be more specially about web applications. Again, knowledge and experience across a range of tools is required.
The role includes mentoring and training team mates.</p>
<p>Skills and experience required include Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python and Ruby, as well as Spring, Hibernate, Rest APIs, Docker and Microserves, among other things.</p>
<p>There are so many different tools being referred to in the required/preferred skills and experience section that you could only build this experience up on the job over a number of years.  Potentially you may even be targeting larger organisations for employment if skills and experience are the priority.</p>

<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
<p>All of the job listing above relate to Java.  The reason is that I want to be a software developer and Java seems a good place to start with that.  I realise that over my career I will probably have to learn other languages.</p>
<p>Why senior roles? I don't just want to be a software developer. I want to be really good at it too. To me, having a goal that I will be a senior Java developer means continually improving my skills to the point where I am highly regarded and am capable of leading a team of developers. </p> 
<p>Right now, I do not have programming skills that I could use to get a software development role.  What I also realise is that in addition to developing my Java skills, I will also have to develop skills in related languages and tools such as JavaScript, SQL, AWS, Angular etc.</p>

<h2>Personal profile</h2>
<p>I completed a Myers-Briggs Indicator test, a learning style test and a Big 5 personality test.</p>

<h3>Myers-Briggs</h3>
<p>The result is that I am an ISTJ-T (Logistician).</p>  
<p>According to 16personalities.com tells me that the defining characteristics for ISTJ-T are <i>'integrity, practical logic and tireless dedication to duty'</i><sup style="font-size:8pt">1</sup>.  I am the details guy.  Not only is this consistent with the results, but is also supported in real life as I am the guy who is usually given the complex tasks and documents to read - i.e. someone who is going to sit down and read and understand the detail in order to get the job done properly. I like facts and I like to understand the framework within which I am expected to work, and from there I can work my job out. This means I can be left to manage my work, leaving management to focus more of their time on those requiring more direct contact and guidance.</p>     
  
<h3>Learning style</h3>
<p>It says I am a VISUAL learner.</p>
<p>I completed a learning style online test at whatismylearningstyle.com<sup style="font-size:8pt">2</sup>. The results suggest I prefer to see the information written down, rather than being given information verbally.  Graphs and diagrams and things help me to understand the content.  I like to structures my learning materials. This is all consistent with the Myers-Briggs result. I like the detail and you tend to have more detail in written materials than what you are given verbally.</p> 

<h3>Big 5 personality test</h3>
<p>I don't know what you would call my personality type based on the Big5 results I got from the Science of People online test I completed.</p>  
<p><i>I scored lower on Extroversion</i>. In other words, I tend more towards introversion.  This is consistent with my experience.</p>
<p><i>I scored very high on Emotional Stability</i>. In other words, low on Neuroticism/Negative Emotionality, again this is consistent with my experience.</p> 
<p><i>I scored very low on Agreeableness</i>. This seems to suggest I am critical and aggressive. This is not consistent with my experience.  Although, if I were to offer an opinion about my level of agreeableness it would still not be particularly high, but mostly on the critical side as I am not a particularly aggressive person.</p>
<p><i>I scored very high on Conscientiousness</i>. In other words, I am careful and diligent. This is consistent with my experience.</p>
<p><i>I scored higher on Intellect/Imagination (openness to experience)</i>. Suggesting a more progressive mindset. As the score percentile I got was 59% I guess this is consistent with my experience. I see the value in traditionalism but am certainly not dogmatic about it.</p> 
<p>These results show that I am very high on emotional stability, lower on agreeableness and high on conscientiousness. I think these traits are consistent with the ISTJ-T (Logistician) Myers-Briggs results. I am more interested in the facts.  While I am willing to listen to others, I often disregard information that seems as though it is based on feelings or personal opinions.  I don't go out of my way to offend people but I am probably going to, politely, challenge intended actions and decisions that I believe are not based on a rational consideration of the facts. People who are led by their feelings and emotions are going to be a challenge to me <i>always</i>.</p> 

<h2>Project idea</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>A key logger logs all keystrokes made on your computer.  The information collected by a keylogger - which can include key stokes, clipboards, screenshots - can be used to steal information such as passwords and other personal information.  Often logged information can be transmitted over the internet.</p>
<p>I propose a desktop application ("the application") for personal use that creates a secure container in which sensitive websites are accessed.  The target audience is people who are less computer savvy, and who are more likely to download malware and less likely to detect its presence on the computer.</p>  
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>In a post on the InfoSec website the author of a post entitled Keyloggers: How they work and more<sup style="font-size:8pt">3</sup>, refers to statistics showing that in 2005 as much as 15% of corporate computes may be infected with a keylogger.  I was not able to find statistics on the rate of infection for personal computers; however, it is easy to imagine that most personal computers are less secure than those managed by corporations.</p>  
<p>According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics website an estimated 126, 300 people experienced identity fraud in 2014-15<sup style="font-size:8pt">4</sup>.  In the same report states that 1.1 million people experienced card fraud, of which 267,800 people were aged 55 and over.  Total losses were estimated at around $2.1 billion dollars.</p>
<p>As we move more online, more personal information will be provided by people to various public and private institutions.  This means more opportunities for hackers to use tools such as keyloggers to steal personal information.  </p>
<h3>Product description</h3>
<p>As noted above the application creates a secure container within which sensitive websites can safely be accessed.  The contents of the container can be displayed on a screen.  However, clipboard and screenshot functionality would be unavailable inside the container.  Key stroke information could not be passed from within to outside the container</p>
<p>Installation would be handled by a standard installer package.  </p>
<p>Depending on how locked down the application needs to be it is possible that the user could see the application as quite restrictive.  On the other hand, the application is designed to do one thing - stop information within the container being passed logged by a keylogger.</p>  
<p>It will be important to limit the functionality of the product, in the sense of what it can be used for.  This will help keep the application and information entered by the user secure.  This will, with the help of experts in user-centred design, also help to develop a product that is as simple to use as possible.  The less it does the less processes, menus and buttons are required to be catered for.  </p>
<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
<p>This project will require application project management tools, such as JIRA, and software development tools like Eclipse.  </p>
<h3>Skills Required</h3>
<p>The project will require people with skills in the relevant programming language to build the software.  Also required will be people with an in-depth knowledge of computer hardware and operating systems such as Windows.  People with skills in user-centred design will help to ensure the application is as simple to use as possible.  Finally, project management staff (project manager, finance etc.) will be required to manage the project.</p>
<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>If successful this project will deliver a simple to use desktop application that people can use to input sensitive personal information or passwords safely into websites.  The application will act as an additional safeguard against identity and password theft.</p>
